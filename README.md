# Matrix Ops (UNIX)

> CS-344 (Operating Systems I) Program

A series of matrix operations written in UNIX.

## How to compile and run:
> 1. Copy/paste all program code into a directory
> 2. In that directory, type the command: `chmod +x generate` to make *generate* function executable  
> 3. Type the command: `chmod +x matrix` to make *matrix* function executable
> 4. Create two (or more) matrices. This can be done by:
> - Typing the command: `generate x y 10` , where x and y are the  number of rows and columns (respectively) you want your matrix to be, and `m1` is the name of the file where it will be stored  
> or  
> - Making your own custom matrix inside a file (columns must be tab separated, and rows must end with a newline character)

# Matrix Ops (UNIX)

> CS-344 (Operating Systems I) Program

A series of matrix operations written in UNIX.

## How to compile and run:
> 1. Copy/paste all program code into a directory
> 2. In that directory, type the command: `chmod +x generate` to make *generate* function executable  
> 3. Type the command: `chmod +x matrix` to make *matrix* function executable
> 4. Create two (or more) matrices. This can be done by:
> - Typing the command: `generate x y 10` , where x and y are the  number of rows and columns (respectively) you want your matrix to be, and `m1` is the name of the file where it will be stored  
> **or**  
> - Making your own custom matrix inside a file (columns must be tab separated, and rows must end with a newline character)  

> Once you have at least two matrices in files, any of the following commands may be ran:
> - `matrix dims [MATRIX]`, where MATRIX is the name of some matrix file  
> - `matrix transpose [MATRIX]`, where MATRIX is the name of some matrix file  
> - `matrix mean [MATRIX]`, where MATRIX is the name of some matrix file  
> - `matrix add [MATRIX_LEFT] [MATRIX_RIGHT]`, where MATRIX_LEFT and MATRIX_RIGHT are two matrix files  
> - `matrix multiply [MATRIX_LEFT] [MATRIX_RIGHT]`, where MATRIX_LEFT and MATRIX_RIGHT are two matrix files
